The goal of this project is to utilize the Superstore dataset to create interactive and insightful visualizations that provide a comprehensive view of key business metrics, such as sales performance, profit margins, and customer behavior, across different product categories and regions. By integrating Tableau Cloud and Tableau Pulse, the project also aims to generate real-time, customizable metrics that enable stakeholders to monitor trends and make informed decisions quickly. The dashboards and metrics will help streamline the analysis of sales data, track key performance indicators (KPIs), and identify opportunities for business growth and optimization.
The dataset includes various dimensions and measures, such as:
•	Dimensions:	Order ID,	Customer Name, Region, Product Category, Ship Mode
•	Measures: Sales, Profit, Quantity,	Discount
